# Loan-Default-Analysis-through-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-

## Problem Statement
Loan providers often struggle with assessing applicants' creditworthiness, especially when dealing with individuals lacking sufficient credit history. This project investigates consumer and loan attributes to ensure that creditworthy applicants are not denied loans while minimizing potential financial losses from defaults.

## Business Objectives
- Identify patterns indicating clients with payment difficulties.
- Ensure consumers capable of repaying loans are not rejected.
- Understand the driving factors behind loan defaults to improve portfolio and risk assessment strategies.

## Data Description
The dataset includes information on loan applications, capturing various consumer attributes and loan characteristics. The analysis focuses on two scenarios:
- Clients with payment difficulties (late payments).
- All other cases where payments are made on time.

## Key Steps in the Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualization and analysis of trends, correlations, and distributions of attributes influencing loan default.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
